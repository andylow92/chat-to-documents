Gradio Chatbot Link Generator

You can also follow the tutorial on https://medium.com/@aalc928/unleash-the-power-of-words-building-a-document-based-chatbot-with-gradio-and-openai-6b998d70fcbd

This code generates a Gradio link that allows users to chat with a document that the chatbot is reading. The chatbot is powered by the GPT-3.5 Turbo model from OpenAI. Users can input text, and the chatbot will provide responses based on the content of the documents it has access to.
Prerequisites

Before using this code, you'll need to have the following:

    Python installed on your machine.

    An OpenAI API key. You can obtain one from the OpenAI platform.

    A directory containing the documents that the chatbot will read and respond to. Make sure to specify the path to this directory in the construct_index function.

Installation

    Clone the repository or download the code to your local machine.

    Install the required Python packages using pip:

    bash

pip install gradio

Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

bash

    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

    Replace "your_api_key_here" with your actual API key.

Usage

    Run the code by executing the script:

    bash

    python your_script_name.py

    Replace your_script_name.py with the name of your Python script containing the provided code.

    Once the script is running, it will create a Gradio interface that allows users to enter text in a textbox.

    Users can type their queries or messages in the textbox and press Enter.

    The chatbot will process the input and provide responses based on the content of the documents in the specified directory.

    The Gradio interface will display the chatbot's responses to the user.

    You can share the Gradio link generated in the console with others to allow them to access and interact with the chatbot.

Customization

You can customize the behavior of the chatbot by modifying the parameters in the code, such as the GPT-3.5 Turbo model's temperature and the maximum input size.
Note

Ensure that your directory containing the documents is correctly specified in the construct_index function. The chatbot's responses will be based on the content of these documents.

This code uses the Gradio library for creating the user interface and the GPT-3.5 Turbo model from OpenAI for chatbot capabilities.
